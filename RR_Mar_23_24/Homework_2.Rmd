# BREAKING BAD

## Question 1: A brief description of the show (use _italics_ for names).

Set in _Albuquerque_, _New Mexico_, between 2008 and 2010, _Breaking Bad_ follows _Walter White_, a meek high school chemistry teacher who transforms into a ruthless player in the local methamphetamine drug trade, driven by a desire to financially provide for his family after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student _Jesse Pinkman_ in a rolling meth lab, _Walter_ and _Jesse_ eventually expand to make larger batches of a special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand. Walter takes on the name "Heisenberg" to mask his identity. Because of his drug-related activities, _Walter_ eventually finds himself at odds with his family, the _Drug Enforcement Administration_ (DEA) through his brother-in-law _Hank Schrader_, the local gangs, and the _Mexican_ drug cartels (including their regional distributors), putting him and his family's lives at risk.

## Question 2: A photo with the logo or a shot from the show itself.
